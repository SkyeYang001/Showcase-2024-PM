        <p> Our food trucks and stands offer typical concession foods such as hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, tacos, and
            savory snacks.
            These stands are scattered about the island, creating easy access for anybody no matter where you might be.
            The “T-Rex Cafe” shop is nearby the T-Rex exhibit, offering all the foods of each stand.

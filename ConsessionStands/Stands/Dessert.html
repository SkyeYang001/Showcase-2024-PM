        <p> There are many stands scattered about Jurassic park offering dessert-type foods such as ice cream, churros, and candies. 
            Both our ice cream and churros are made in the park, and we offer a large variety of candy. 
            Just be sure not to let any dinosaurs get to your sweets.

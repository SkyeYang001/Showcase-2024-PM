            <p> Jurassic Park is a island that has many locations and stands.
                Many customers can be confused with where things are at as itâ€™s complex design and geographically where
                made
                for our main attraction.
                Check the map page for more info of the island and have a visual on the locations of our buildings and
                stands.

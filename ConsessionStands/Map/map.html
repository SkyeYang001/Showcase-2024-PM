    <p> Jurassic Park is located on an island called Isla Nublar, near Puerto Rico.
        Jurassic Park has locations for its staff, visitors, and dinosaurs.
        Many visitors will first be at the dock at the east and travel to the visitor center.
        As you travel, you can stop by at any concession stands you come across, they're all over the park.
        Our concession stands provide items such as foods, sweets, snacks, and more.
        Please note that, if you want to buy any product in Jurassic Park, you have to purchase the JurassicPAY currency
        specially for our establishment.
